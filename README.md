# Flutter Food ordering App 
We have made a food ordering system. It will help the restaurant to do all the functionalities more accurately and in a faster way and to maintain records, as many restaurants do that in a manual way. Users will Register and Login to the system then place an order from the menu of the restaurant the app will manage all the processes of taking the order, payment and process the order. Users can also view order history and edit their profile details. The admin can add and edit food items and can view the order details.
